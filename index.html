    <h1> Python Challenge (Pybank & PyPoll) </h1>

    <p> In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing
      the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called
      budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.
      (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)
